This is a compilation of my most recent works with regression models. <br>
Each folder has one .md File which. These ones will allow you to glimpse at my analyses. The rendering is not that good (Looks funky). That's why you should check out their rendered versions (Link on each file).

Here is a summary of each one of the analyses posted in this repo:

1.- [Spotify Regression](https://incomparable-kringle-69dff2.netlify.app):
        My Favorite project. I worked with raw data gathered from Spotify's API to make a significant regression model that predicts an Artist         daily Streams (Leading to daily earnings) with multiple variables. Validated with 95% confidence R^2
        
2.- [House Prices](https://gentle-meringue-8bb3f3.netlify.app):
        Awesome Project. Huge Data set to be found in Kaggle. Managed to get a 95% confidence R^2 in my test data. This while keeping                  interpretability intact. Multiple variables and explanations in file.

3.- [Car Analysis](https://zesty-kheer-8ce4a9.netlify.app):
        Interesting Project. I myself gathered all data points for this analysis from multiple sources online (Multiple Car Dealership websites)
        After Gathering almost 100 different prices for different car mileage. I'm able to predict with 90% accuracy for how much I'll be able         to sell my car for when it reaches 220k miles. (All else held constant)

4.- Midterm prediction:
        School Project. Predict wioth my midterm grade, my final exam grade by using past grades for a variety of years for this class.

5.- Logistic Prediction:
        School Project. Similar to Midterm Prediction, but using Logistic Regression, find the probabilities of another MATH class student of          getting an A depending on multiple variables.

6.- Regression Theory:
        School Project. Explains main topics of regression theory.

7.- Sampling Distribution:
        School Project. Explains how sampling distribution works.

8.-Weather Prediction:
        School Project. First dummy regression project. Teacher designed this assignment to be a failed regression model in order to teach             main principles. Model is later used in Theory assignment to look for key aspects on getting a better regression model.


All of these projects are of my own making. I wrote every insight and line of code in RStudio.
