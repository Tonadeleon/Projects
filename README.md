This is a compilation of my most recent works with regression models. <br>
Feel free to read on the descriptions below to know what the analyses go about. Click on their respective links to take a look at them.

Here is a summary of each one of the analyses posted in this repo:

1.- [Spotify Regression](https://spotify-regression.netlify.app/):
        My Favorite project. I worked with raw data gathered from Spotify's API to make a significant regression model that predicts an Artist         daily Streams (Leading to daily earnings) with multiple variables. Validated with 93% confidence R^2
        
2.- [House Prices](https://gentle-meringue-8bb3f3.netlify.app):
        Awesome Project. Huge Data set to be found in Kaggle. Managed to get a 95% confidence R^2 in my test data. This while keeping                  interpretability intact. Multiple variables and explanations in file.

3.- [Car Analysis](https://zesty-kheer-8ce4a9.netlify.app):
        Interesting Project. I gathered all data for this analysis from multiple sources online (Multiple Car Dealership websites)
        After Gathering almost 100 different prices for different car mileage. I'm able to predict with 90% accuracy for how much I'll be able         to sell my car for when it reaches 220k miles. (All else held constant)

4.- [Midterm prediction](https://polite-kringle-2be27c.netlify.app):
        School Project. Predict with my midterm grade, my final exam grade by using past grades for a variety of years for this class.

5.- [Logistic Prediction](https://papaya-semolina-8e58ef.netlify.app):
        School Project. Similar to Midterm Prediction, but using Logistic Regression, find the probabilities of a pre-requisite MATH class student of         getting an A depending on multiple variables.

6.- Regression Theory:
        School Project. Explains main topics of regression theory.

7.- Sampling Distribution:
        School Project. Explains how sampling distribution works.

8.-Weather Prediction:
        School Project. First dummy regression project. Teacher designed this assignment to be a failed regression model in order to teach             main principles. Model is later used in Theory assignment to look for key aspects on getting a better regression model.


All of these projects are of my own making. I wrote every insight and line of code in RStudio. If you want to take a look at the coding behind, go to the .Rmd files in the above folders. <br><br>Only the first 5 analyses have a rendered html link to them. However, you can read the rest of them here in github in their respective .md files. <br><br>
Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoyed it.
